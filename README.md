This is a HUGE modpack that aims to make GTA Vice City NextGen Edition what deserves, restoration and modernizations. This modpack is basically a collection of mods made by the VCNE modding community and DayL's modding community that aims to restore features from the Original GTA Vice City, adding faithful yet modern features from GTA San Andreas, GTA V and from GTA IV itself to ensure the most definitive experience possible.This is a HUGE modpack that aims to make GTA Vice City NextGen Edition what deserves, restoration and modernizations.

I personally spent above 3 months trying to mix all the mods available at the VCNE modding discord and make them compatible with each other, the mods included in this modpack were picked carefully so it won't ruin or destroy the original Vice City artstyle that we know while making the game more modern and better than before.
